## 

 - Minimize the risk
 
 - You are as secure as your weakest link

## CI/CD â†’ Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

. . . 

### (Checking in code and continuous building)

## 

 - It was emphasized on delivery not security

 - DevOps teams  may lack security knowledge

 - Traditional automated testing does not focus on Security Testing

 - Figure out the risk of the libraries on our applications

## OWASP
